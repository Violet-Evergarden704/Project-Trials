# Project-Trials
This repo includes my self trials of some projects, with java or other languages.
## Greedy Snake Game
A simple greedy snake game, with java.
The 1st version gets help with ai, and as the first project ever done, it's a simple start.
The game supports arrow keys to control the snake, and 'R' key to pause or continue the game.
